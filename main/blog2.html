			<h1>Financial institutions set to realise Rs 80,000 crore from IBC in FY20: ICRA</h1>
			<img src="img/blog7.jpg" class="responsive" alt="image">
			<h3>NCLT benches are being set up at Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh and at Indore in Madhya Pradesh. </h3>
			<p align="justify">MUMBAI: Financial creditors would realise more than Rs 80,000 crore in this financial year from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) mainly driven by two large accounts Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel and Power.

This is 21% higher compared to about Rs 66,000 crore realised in the last financial year. Both Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel and Power are part of the RBI’s list of the 12 largest defaulting companies announced in June 2017.<br><br>

“Successful completion of the corporate insolvency resolution process for these two accounts would bring closure to eight companies from the RBI’s list and could help strengthen the confidence in the IBC, despite the significant delays seen in the process with most of the CIRPs lasting more than 500 days,” Abhishek Dafria, Vice President & Co-Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.

The rating company expects number of cases being admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to continue to increase, especially from the operational creditors who are responsible for 50% of all cases admitted by the NCLT.

The progress of the resolution process under the IBC has been hampered over the past two years by the over-burdened NCLTs, innumerable litigations, defiant promoters and failing sectors, said ICRA.

As of March 31, 2019, 715 cases of defaulting corporate debtors had been closed under the IBC. Out of this, 378 corporate debtors were ordered into liquidation, while only 92 corporate insolvency resolution process yielded a resolution plan where the companies continue to operate as going-concerns.<br>

In April 2019, the Supreme Court cancelled the February 2018 circular of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which directed banks to recognise one-day defaults by large corporates and refer the large defaulting entities as those with loans in excess of Rs 2,000 crore to the NCLT if a resolution plan was not in place 180 days after the default.

ICRA said that the decision by Supreme Court is a blow to the IBC and it is important for the RBI to find a new mechanism to ensure that resolution of stressed assets happen in a disciplined manner.

The RBI’s circular would have channelled the resolution process of the defaulting corporate debtors through the framework set by the IBC and thereby encouraged the creditors to approach the NCLT at an early stage of default.<br><br>

Also, the NCLTs continue to remain heavily burdened as the number of cases being admitted continues to increase quarter-on-quarter with the highest quarterly admissions of 359 cases reported in the fourth quarter. As the timelines for the corporate insolvency resolution process continue to get stretched, with 32% of the on-going CIRPs as on March 31, 2019 having already crossed the maximum allowed time of 270 days, the number of admitted cases that are yet to be resolved are only increasing.

As of March 31, 2019, the number of on-going CIRPs had increased to 1,143. NCLT benches are being set up at Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh and at Indore in Madhya Pradesh</p>
